            output: 'Josh Allen faces a challenging matchup against the Patriots defense this week. Despite strong recent performances averaging 24.9 points over his last three games, the 18mph wind conditions at Gillette Stadium will significantly impact his deep passing accuracy. Allen\'s mobility gives him an advantage in windy conditions, as he can extend plays and find rushing opportunities. His recent 31.4-point performance against Miami shows excellent form, but the Patriots\' improved pass rush and Bill Belichick\'s defensive schemes pose legitimate concerns. The wind factor reduces his ceiling from elite to good, making him a solid QB1 play with slightly limited upside.',

            output: 'This AFC East rivalry game projects as a defensive struggle with the 42.5 total reflecting realistic expectations. The absence of the Patriots\' top receiver significantly limits their already modest passing attack, forcing greater reliance on their running game and short intermediate routes. Buffalo\'s questionable RB2 status could impact their offensive balance, though Josh Allen\'s dual-threat ability provides offensive stability. Wind conditions favor the under, as both teams will likely emphasize ball control and minimize turnovers. The Patriots\' defensive improvements and game script favoring clock management support a lower-scoring affair. Expect a grind-it-out game with emphasis on field position and defensive stops.',

            output: 'Week 8 historically produces above-average RB performances due to several converging factors. Teams begin emphasizing ball control as weather deteriorates, leading to increased carries for feature backs. The past three seasons show a 23% spike in RB games of 25+ points during Week 8 compared to the season average. This year\'s weather forecasts suggest similar conditions, with rain or wind expected in 6 of 16 games. Additionally, several playoff-contending teams face favorable matchups against defenses allowing 4.8+ yards per carry. Target volume-heavy backs in potential negative game scripts, as garbage-time receiving work becomes crucial. Christian McCaffrey, Derrick Henry, and Nick Chubb show the highest ceiling potential based on usage trends and matchup profiles.',

            output: 'Oracle\'s preference for Cooper Kupp reflects several analytical advantages over Davante Adams. Kupp\'s 28% target share leads Adams\' 22%, providing higher floor security. The Rams face a Cardinals defense allowing 8.2 yards per target to slot receivers, Kupp\'s primary alignment, while Adams encounters a Saints defense ranking 3rd against perimeter receivers. Kupp\'s recent snap count recovery (89% last two weeks vs 78% early season) indicates full health return, contrasting with Adams\' lingering toe injury concerns. Game script favors Kupp, as the Rams project as 3.5-point favorites likely requiring sustained offensive drives. Oracle\'s 78% confidence stems from Kupp\'s superior target volume, matchup advantage, health status, and favorable game environment creating multiple paths to ceiling outcomes.',
