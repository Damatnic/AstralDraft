- **App Routing**: Integrated with main application router
- **Lazy Loading**: Dynamic import for performance optimization

### Service Integration
- **Oracle Analytics**: Integration with existing Oracle analytics service
- **Auth Service**: User authentication checks
- **Data Persistence**: Analytics data storage and retrieval

## Usage Examples

### Accessing the Dashboard
The Real-Time Analytics Dashboard can be accessed through:
1. Navigation menu (Analytics Hub → Real-Time Analytics)
2. Direct route: `state.currentView = 'REALTIME_ANALYTICS'`
3. Deep linking support for bookmarking

### API Integration
```typescript
// Get real-time metrics
const metrics = await enhancedAnalyticsService.getRealTimeMetrics('24h');

// Get predictive insights
const insights = await enhancedAnalyticsService.getPredictiveInsights('7d');

// Generate analytics report
const report = await enhancedAnalyticsService.generateAnalyticsReport();
```

### WebSocket Events
```typescript
// Listen for real-time updates
useWebSocket('/ws/analytics', {
  onMessage: (data) => {
    const update = JSON.parse(data);
    if (update.type === 'metrics_update') {
      updateMetrics(update.payload);
    }
  }
});
```

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
1. **Advanced Machine Learning**: Enhanced prediction algorithms
2. **Custom Dashboards**: User-configurable dashboard layouts
3. **Alert System**: Real-time notifications for significant changes
