## Architecture

### Service Layer (`adminService.ts`)

The `AdminService` class provides the core functionality:

```typescript
class AdminService {
  // User Management
  async getAllUsers(page, limit, filters)
  async getUserDetails(userId)
  async updateUserStatus(adminId, userId, status, reason)
  async addUserFlag(adminId, userId, flag)

  // Contest Management
  async getAllContests(page, limit, filters)
  async createContest(adminId, contestData)
  async cancelContest(adminId, contestId, reason)

  // Payment Management
  async getAllPayments(page, limit, filters)
  async processRefund(adminId, paymentId, amount, reason)

  // Oracle Management
  async getOracleMetrics()
  async updateOracleConfig(adminId, config)
  async triggerOracleRetrain(adminId)

  // System Analytics
  async getSystemMetrics()
  async getDashboardData()
}
```
