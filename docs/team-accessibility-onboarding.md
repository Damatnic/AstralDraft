## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Test Failures
**Problem**: Accessibility tests failing
**Solution**:
1. Check test output for specific violations
2. Review [Component Accessibility Checklist](./component-accessibility-checklist.md)
3. Fix violations following [Best Practices Guide](./accessibility-best-practices.md)
4. Re-run tests to verify fixes

**Problem**: Dashboard not generating
**Solution**:
1. Ensure tests pass first: `npm run test:accessibility`
2. Check Node.js version (requires Node 16+)
3. Clear output directory: `rm -rf accessibility-reports && npm run accessibility:dashboard`
4. Check for ES module compatibility issues

### Development Issues
**Problem**: Can't navigate component with keyboard
**Solution**:
1. Add `tabindex="0"` to focusable elements
2. Implement keyboard event handlers
3. Test with Tab, Enter, Space, and Arrow keys
4. Review [Keyboard Navigation Guide](./accessibility-best-practices.md#keyboard-navigation)

**Problem**: Screen reader not announcing content
**Solution**:
1. Add appropriate ARIA labels: `aria-label`, `aria-labelledby`
2. Use semantic HTML elements when possible
3. Add ARIA live regions for dynamic content
4. Test with actual screen reader software

### Dashboard Issues
**Problem**: Dashboard shows outdated data
**Solution**:
1. Run fresh tests: `npm run test:accessibility`
2. Regenerate dashboard: `npm run accessibility:dashboard`
3. Clear browser cache and reload
4. Check GitHub Actions for deployment issues
