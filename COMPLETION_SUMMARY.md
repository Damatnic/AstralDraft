## 📋 **IMMEDIATE ACTION ITEMS**

### **Week 1 Priority**
1. Complete Oracle routes implementation
2. Implement JWT authentication system
3. Add service layer unit tests
4. Fix remaining placeholder in scoring service

### **Week 2 Priority**
1. Complete API integration tests
2. Implement security measures
3. Database schema validation
4. Basic performance optimization

---

## 💡 **QUICK WINS (Low Effort, High Impact)**

1. **Oracle Scoring Service Fix** (2 hours) - Single placeholder method
2. **Error Handling Standardization** (4 hours) - Consistent patterns
3. **API Documentation Update** (3 hours) - Complete existing docs
4. **Health Check Endpoints** (2 hours) - Basic monitoring

---

## 🚨 **RISK FACTORS**

### **Technical Risks**
- API rate limits from external services
- Performance under real user load
- Security vulnerabilities in auth flow

### **Timeline Risks**
- Testing phase might reveal integration issues
- External API dependencies could cause delays
- Performance optimization might require architecture changes

### **Mitigation Strategies**
- Implement caching for API calls
- Load testing early in process
- Security audit before production
- Staged rollout with monitoring

---

## 📈 **RESOURCE REQUIREMENTS**

### **Team Composition (Recommended)**
- **1 Senior Backend Developer** - Routes, auth, database (60 hours)
- **1 QA Engineer** - Testing framework and validation (50 hours)
- **1 Frontend Developer** - Integration and polish (30 hours)
- **1 DevOps Engineer** - Deployment and monitoring (25 hours)

### **Timeline Options**

#### **Option A: Fast Track (1 week)**
- 4 developers working full-time
- Focus on MVP features only
- Higher risk, minimal testing

#### **Option B: Balanced (2 weeks)**  
- 2-3 developers working efficiently
- Comprehensive testing included
- Recommended approach

#### **Option C: Thorough (3 weeks)**
- 1-2 developers with detailed work
- Extensive testing and documentation
- Lower risk, highest quality
