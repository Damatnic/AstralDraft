- **React Vendor**: 245KB (properly bundled)
- **Code Splitting**: Optimized with lazy loading
- **Asset Caching**: Configured with immutable headers

---

## Critical Files Modified:

### API Layer:
- `/services/apiClient.ts` - Fixed all API endpoints
- `/services/secureApiClient.ts` - Added security layer
- `/backend/routes/auth.ts` - Fixed authentication flow
- `/backend/middleware/security.ts` - Enhanced security

### Components:
- `/components/oracle/TrainingDataManager.tsx` - Fixed type issues
- `/components/oracle/OracleRealTimeDashboard.tsx` - Fixed poll handling
- `/components/trade/TradeAnalysisDashboard.tsx` - Fixed map functions
- `/hooks/useOracleRealTime.ts` - Complete rewrite for type safety

### Configuration:
- `/vite.config.ts` - Fixed React bundling
- `/netlify.toml` - Configured for production
- `/backend/server.ts` - Fixed middleware ordering
